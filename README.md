# BankPortfolioProject
 
A small example project.  It includes a react app and a .NET 7 API.

# How to run
Don't it's not finished.

# Code walkthrough
It uses sqlite for the database, which I chose not because I know anything about sqlite but because it doesn't require a running server.  At the moment it doesn't have any real validation, authorization, or automated testing.  While I can do all of those things, they're somewhat time consuming and/or difficult to use properly in a project this small.  It does include attributed dependency injection, kind of a lot of generics, what I like to think of as a relatively pretty UI, and a scalable and maintainable setup.
